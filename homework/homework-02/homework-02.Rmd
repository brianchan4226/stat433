```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Question 1

```{r}
count(flights, is.na(dep_time))
count(flights, is.na(dep_delay))
count(flights, is.na(arr_time))
count(flights, is.na(arr_delay))
count(flights, is.na(tailnum))
count(flights, is.na(air_time))
##sum(is.na.data.frame(flights))
```
I am quite sure these are quite self-explanatory with the name of the variable. It means the nnumber of rows that are missing.


## Question 2

```{r}
transmute(flights, 
          dep_time, 
          minute = ((dep_time %/% 100) * 60) + (dep_time %% 100))
```


## Question 3

```{r}
flights2 <- flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(cancelled_flights = sum(is.na(dep_delay)),
            arr_delay = sum(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(flights2, aes(x = cancelled_flights, y = arr_delay)) + geom_point()
```
